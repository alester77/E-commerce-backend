# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

## Description
I created this to make a back end for a e-commerce site. I wanted to be able to look up categories, products, and tags. I wanted to be able to view information, update, post, and delete. Using a database like this would make it easier to keep track of all the changing things that happen in an e-commerce site. I learned more about models and routing and how to structure requests.
I had a hard time getting certain requests to run but with a lot of trial and error I was able to make it work. I was able to learn more about MySQL, and sequelize.

## Installation

To get started, one would have to open up the terminal. First you would have to run npm i to install the necessary packages. From there you would have to log into mysql and install the database by running source db/schema.sql. Then you would quit and run npm run seeds to fill the database. From there you would be able to run node server.js. Now the server is live and you can run the requests from Postman or insomnia.
